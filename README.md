iMessage clone is a web application, which allows you to message other users of this app with ease. The purpose of this app is to put my little knowledge of different web-development technologies into practice.

Keep in mind, that your email will not be validated. Therefore, you may even use an email, that doesn't exist (however, it should look like one).

2. Go to the inbox page. Your dialogues are displayed in the left column. You can create a new dialogue - all you have to do is find your recipient by their username, and send a message.

3. Chat! If you want to test everything out yourself - you can create several 'fake' accounts, and message between them.
